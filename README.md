# PongInABox
Programs an Arduino pong game for two people.
The hardware for which this code was written specifically is as listed. Porting to different hardware, though not guaranteed, should not be terribly hard.

#### Project-specific hardware:
  2 x Adafruit LED Charlieplexed Matrix - 9x16 LEDs - White \n
  2 x Adafruit 16x9 Charlieplexed PWM LED Matrix Driver - IS31FL3731 \n
  2 x Adafruit Linear SoftPot (Ribbon Sensor) - 100mm \n
  1 x Arduino Uno R3 (Atmega328 - assembled) \n

#### Presentation suggestions:
The hardware that doesn't have to be user-facing is hidden in a box that is appropriate. The user-facing hardware is
